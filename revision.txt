rev change
r1  Initial commit
r2  External code can be accessed using the ExternalProcessor which will look in the cudir/"exo" directory for plugins
r2  A plugin is a directory that contains one or more library (*.dll) files which contains one or more Types with names that begin with 'ResExtern'
r2  In these objects any method or property decorated with the 'Extern' attribute will be available in the res://exo namespace under a name matching
r2  the Type name starting after 'ResExtern'.  Example; a class named ResExternEmployee which contains a method called 'GetHireDate' which is decorated with the 'Extern' attribute
r2  this method would be available at: res://exo/Employee/GetHireDate/{EmployeeId}/ if (and only if) the module name (i.e. "Employee") is listed in the exo.mod config file that is read in the 
r2  Constructor of the ExternalProcessor
