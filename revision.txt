rev change
r1	Initial commit
r2	External code can be accessed using the ExternalProcessor which will look in the cudir/"ext" directory for plugins
r2	A plugin is a directory that contains one or more library (*.dll) files which contains one or more Types with names that begin with 'ResExtern'
r2	In these objects any method or property decorated with the 'Extern' attribute will be available in the res://ext namespace under a name matching
r2	the Type name starting after 'ResExtern'.  Example; a class named ResExternEmployee which contains a method called 'GetHireDate' which is 
r2	decorated with the 'Extern' attribute this method would be available at: res://ext/Employee/GetHireDate/{EmployeeId}/ if (and only if) the module name 
r2	(i.e. "Employee") is listed in the ext.mod config file that is read in the Constructor of the ExternalProcessor
r3	Narrowed revision 2 text
r3	DelayedRecord class created implements IUnitRecord and serves as a wrapper for the same, its job is to pass down the "import" record for in-scope values
r3	Fixed ResourceFetchedToDeterminUnitValue() test and created LoadedModulesResolvedByName() test which calls a (test) module which imports another (std) module and is able
r3	to access units of the std module without having to refer the std module again
r3	Purpose is to allow custom, effectful processing of a resource - Can be used to get a "reference" to a module and only later resolve the units using 'import' values that 
r3	were passed in at creation time and/or any time after.
r4	All Processors and Providers should register themselves as a part of their constructor
r4	Created Environment static class with method to 'Start' using IFileSystem
r4	IFileSystem moved to ResourceConfig 
r4	IFileSystem GetNewBase(path)-> IFileSystem method, this should return an object that points to a subdirectory of the original IFIleSytem base path indicated by the path arg
r4	Rnamed ExternalProcessor to ExternalResourceProvider, new ExternalResourceProcessor created to implement IDelayedProcessor 
r4	DataFormat for accessing external resources changed from 'exo' to 'ext'
